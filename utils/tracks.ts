  description: `“On the Fly” is a track that pulses with the vibrant energy of tribal house, a genre renowned for its potent rhythms and capacity to ignite dance floors. As the beat rolls forward, a series of chopped vocals enter, each snippet carefully sliced and interwoven into the fabric of the instrumental. These vocal cuts are not mere accents; they are integrated as percussive elements, adding layers of rhythm upon the already irresistible core beat. They echo and reverberate, mimicking the call and response of tribal gatherings, and serve to deepen the connection between the music and the primal urge to move. A rhythmic fusion, where every beat, every vocal chop, every rise in tempo is meticulously crafted to ensure that the energy not only remains high but escalates. It's music that doesn't just want you to dance; it compels you, with every fiber of its being, to dance all night long.`,

This track leaves no room for breath, with an insistent rhythm that captures the listener's attention from the very first beat. Through its penetrating lyrics, Puro Lobo addresses the struggles faced by young people dealing with addictions, left to fend for themselves in a world where institutions offer scant assistance and a society increasingly indifferent to their hardships. '14' is a cry of anger and frustration against a system that seems to turn its back on the most vulnerable, a work that pushes the listener to reflect on the challenges faced by the new generations.`,

  description: `"Perrea" in spanish means 'twerk'. The track is a sun-soaked fusion of Latin-EDM, bursting with the zest of reggaeton's pulsating rhythms. It opens with the strumming of a guitar, its notes warm and inviting, conjuring images of a tropical paradise. This melody is the golden hour of the song, setting the scene for an escape to an endless summer. The vocal line dances over the track, a melodic embodiment of freedom and joy. The lyrics are an ode to the carefree ecstasy of summertime revelry, celebrating the here and now. The instrumental builds with an impetuous energy, each beat a heartbeat pushing you closer to the dance floor. The reggaeton influence is undeniable, with its signature dembow rhythm acting as the backbone of the track, urging you to move with abandon. The blend of EDM's electronic dynamism with the organic sounds of Latin music creates a track that is both contemporary and timeless.`,
