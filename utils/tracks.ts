The overwhelming flood of misinformation about vaccines, Covid-19, and various other topics ignited my frustration. My social media accounts faced shadow banning because I exposed falsehoods with concrete evidence. Originally released in November 2020 after returning from a road trip to Los Angeles, this song serves as a testament to those who supported my previous release, “Stimulation Growth.” As a token of appreciation, those who minted “Stimulation Growth” will receive an airdrop of this song. Stay tuned for more music coming soon! In conclusion, always remember to think for yourself—it’s your strongest asset.\n\nProduced, recorded, mix and mastered by Goose Pärk. Enjoy the video as well; it was shot in Little Haiti Miami, FL. Video shot by John Atis. Edited by Goose Pärk",

  title: "Perrea",
  artists: ["Joe Bertè"],
  description: `"Perrea" in spanish means 'twerk'. The track is a sun-soaked fusion of Latin-EDM, bursting with the zest of reggaeton's pulsating rhythms. It opens with the strumming of a guitar, its notes warm and inviting, conjuring images of a tropical paradise. This melody is the golden hour of the song, setting the scene for an escape to an endless summer. The vocal line dances over the track, a melodic embodiment of freedom and joy. The lyrics are an ode to the carefree ecstasy of summertime revelry, celebrating the here and now. The instrumental builds with an impetuous energy, each beat a heartbeat pushing you closer to the dance floor. The reggaeton influence is undeniable, with its signature dembow rhythm acting as the backbone of the track, urging you to move with abandon. The blend of EDM's electronic dynamism with the organic sounds of Latin music creates a track that is both contemporary and timeless.`,

  description: `"Sing for Me" weaves a tapestry of romantic sentiments with its dreamy, melodic voice that floats ethereally over a bed of rhythmic instrumentals. As the chorus approaches, there's a palpable sense of anticipation, like the moment before a sunrise. And then, with an exhilarating rush, the powerful EDM drop cascades over the senses, an electrifying blend of synth and bass that pulses through the body. The essence of "Sing for Me" lies in its ability to transport the listener to a space where love is both a quiet whisper and a triumphant shout, all encapsulated within a melody that lingers long after the final note has faded.`,

At its core is a mantra, a lyrical repetition that echoes throughout the song, becoming a rallying cry for the listener.\n\nThe words, delivered with warmth by **Adam Clay's voice**, carry a profound message of **hope and liberation**. As the music builds, the mantra gains intensity, reinforcing its transformative power.\n\nThe combination of the hypnotic repetition, the dynamic progression of the house beats, and the evocative sounds from beyond infuse the track with a unique energy. It's a musical paradox—dark yet uplifting, grounding yet transcendent, and ultimately a sonic journey that invites the listener to embrace the unknown with open arms.",
